# Tips when using Multipacks
## Too lazy to run ``multipacks-cli pack build a_very_long_path/mypack/redesignv2 --include resources --output /home/username/.minecraft/resourcespack/mypack-resources.zip``?
You can use ``--watch`` option to watch for changes inside your pack folder. Any changes you've made will rebuild package so you don't have to run that one long command again. Works well with F3 + T shortcut!

You can stop by using Ctrl + C in terminal or just... close it.
